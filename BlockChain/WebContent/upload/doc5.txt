Cricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a cricket field at the centre of which 
is a rectangular 22 yard long pitch with a target called the wicket a set of three wooden stumps upon which two bails sit
 at each end Each phase of play is called an innings during which one team bats 
attempting to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents field
 Depending on the type of match, the teams have one or two innings apiece and 
when the first innings ends the teams swap roles for the next innings. Except in matches which result in a draw 
the winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained.

Before a match begins the two team captains meet on the pitch for the toss to determine which team will bat first 
Two batsmen and eleven fielders then enter the field and play begins when a member of the fielding team 
known as the bowler delivers the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end 
which is guarded by one of the batsmen, known as the striker

In addition to the bowler the fielding team includes the wicket-keeper 
a specialist who stands behind the striker's wicket. The wicket-keeper is also the only player on the fielding 
side permitted to wear gloves. The nine other fielders are tactically deployed around the field by their captain
 usually in consultation with the bowler The striker takes guard on a crease marked on the pitch four feet in front of the wicket
 His role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps by using his bat and simultaneously
 to strike it well enough to score runs. The other batsman known as the non-striker waits at the opposite end of the pitch near the bowler
 The bowler's objectives are to prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman A dismissed batsman who is declared to be out
 must leave the field to be replaced by a teammate An over is a set of six deliveries bowled by the same bowler
 The next over is bowled from the other end of the pitch by a different bowler
